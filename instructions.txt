Please run the Main class. If you want to insert the encoding, insert them there.

Code Description :

I take the input encode instructions. I perform the encoding accoringly in the keyboardEncoder method. It takes in the
encoding instructions and encodes and returns the 2d array keyboard.

Then the EncodeString method then takes in the input text. Then I used a map to get the positions of the characters in
the keyboard as it is O(1) complexity, hence would be faster for large scale encoding. Then using the position in the
unencoded keyboard, I get the current encoded value of that position, add it to the string buffer and then return it as a
string.


Complexity:
 Assuming n rows and m columns -
 Vertical Flip Complexity - O(m * n/2)
 Horizontal Flip Complexity - O(n * m/2)
 Shift - O(m*n)

 KeyBoardEncoding - O(n/2) + O(m/2) + O(m*n) = O(mn)

 EncodeString - O(n) - when n = length of input string.
